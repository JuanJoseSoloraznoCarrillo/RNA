# RNA (Redes Neuronales Artificiales)

## Overview

This project contains Python scripts for training and testing artificial neural networks (ANNs) for different tasks. The scripts use numpy for numerical operations and random for generating random numbers.

## Folders

### Entregables/Ejercicio_Biblioteca

- **Ejercicio_Biblioteca.py**: This script trains a neural network to classify books based on their weight and frequency of use. The network has two neurons and uses a step function as the activation function.

#### Usage

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
python Ejercicio_Biblioteca.py
```

### ClasificarFrutas

- **ClasificarFrutas.py**: This script trains a neural network to classify fruits based on their color and weight. The network uses a single neuron and a step function as the activation function.

#### Usage

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
python ClasificarFrutas.py
```
